# Excel-Project_Road-Accident-Dashboard
Road accidents present a substantial threat to public safety, and the analysis of accident data plays a crucial role in identifying patterns, areas at high risk, and factors that contribute to accidents. 
Through this project, we will gain expertise in utilizing the robust capabilities of Excel to convert unprocessed accident data into an engaging and dynamic dashboard with visually appealing representations.

This project consist a few steps:


## Data Exploration
- Firstly, we need to learn on how to navigate and explore our dataset using Excel's built-in features. Understand the structure of our data, including the number of rows and columns, data types, and column headers.
- The art of sorting and filtering data in Excel will be a great help. Discover techniques to arrange our data in ascending or descending order based on specific columns. Use filtering options to extract subsets of data based on criteria, enabling us to focus on specific segments of interest.

## Data Cleaning
- In this project, there is a few errors that we need to look for. One of them is identify and remove duplicate records from our dataset. Excel provides tools to detect and eliminate duplicate values based on specific columns, enabling us to work with clean and unique data.
- We also have address inconsistencies in our data using Excel's functions and techniques. By learning on how to clean up inconsistent naming conventions, merge or split columns, and correct errors using find-and-replace and other data manipulation methods.
- We also have done with data formatting and standardization. It consists of how we ensure consistent data formats across our dataset. Learn how to modify data formats, convert text to numbers, dates, or vice versa, and standardize variables to maintain consistency and facilitate analysis.


## Data Processing
- Next, what we are doing for this step will be data aggregation and summarization our data using Excel's built-in functions. The use of techniques to calculate sums, averages, counts, percentages, and other summary statistics to gain insights into our dataset.
- It essential to use the pivot table because it is a powerful tools in Excel that allow us to quickly summarize and analyze large datasets. With pivot tables, we can transform rows and columns of data into a compact and meaningful format, enabling us to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.



## Data Visualization
- Lastly, by adding a new sheet below. We can design it to be interactive dashboard as below.
